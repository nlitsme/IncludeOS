================================================
IncludeOS is a [Unikernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unikernel) written from scratch in C++, designed for x86 hardware virtualization, with no dependencies except for the virtual hardware. [Read more on the wiki](https://github.com/hioa-cs/IncludeOS/wiki). 

## It's a research prototype!
IncludeOS is not production ready, not feature complete, and very much a work in progress. However, it has been shown to outperform Linux virtual machines in terms of CPU usage by 5-20%, and memory usage by orders of magnitude, running a simple DNS service (both platforms ran the same binary). Preliminary performance results and a (now outdated) overview of IncludeOS will appear in an [IEEE CloudCom 2015](http://2015.cloudcom.org/) paper, titled *IncludeOS: A resource efficient unikernel for cloud services*. A [preprint is available here](doc/papers/IncludeOS_IEEE_CloudCom2015_PREPRINT.pdf), but for any [citations please refer to the publications section](https://github.com/hioa-cs/IncludeOS/wiki/Publications) in the [Wiki](https://github.com/hioa-cs/IncludeOS/wiki).

## Build status
We're working towards automating everything with our Jenkins CI server at [jenkins.includeos.org](http://jenkins.includeos.org/). Jenkins is currently only testing on KVM/Linux, but more platforms will come. We do manual tests on virtualbox, before releases.

### Key features
* **Extreme memory footprint**: A minimal bootable image, including bootloader, operating system components and a complete C++ standard library is currently 693K when optimized for size.
* **KVM and VirtualBox support** with full virtualization, using [x86 hardware virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization) whenever available (it is on most modern x86 CPU's). In principle IncludeOS should run on any x86 hardware platform, even on a physical x86 computer, given appropriate drivers. Officially, we develop for- and test on [Linux KVM](http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page), which power the [OpenStack IaaS cloud](https://www.openstack.org/), and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org), which means that you can run your IncludeOS service on both Linux, Microsoft Windows and Apple OS X. 
* **C++11/14 support**
    * Full C++11/14 language support with [clang](http://clang.llvm.org) v3.6 and later.
    * Standard C++ library** (STL) [libc++](http://libcxx.llvm.org) from [LLVM](http://llvm.org/)
    * Exceptions and stack unwinding (currently using [libgcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Libgcc.html))
    * *Note:* Certain language features, such as threads and filestreams are currently missing backend support. 
* **Standard C library** using [newlib](https://sourceware.org/newlib/) from [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com/)
* **Virtio Network driver** with DMA. [Virtio](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=virtio) provides a highly efficient and widely supported I/O virtualization. Like most implementations IncludeOS currently uses "legacy mode", but we're working towards the new [Virtio 1.0 OASIS standard](http://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.0/virtio-v1.0.html)
* **A highly modular TCP/IP-stack** written from scratch, still under heavy development.
    * TCP: Just enough to serve HTTP
    * UDP: Enough to support a high performance DNS service
    * DHCP: Basic support, tested on VirtualBox and KVM
    * ICMP: Enough to answer ping, no control messages yet
    * ARP
    * Ethernet
    * IPv6 support under active development

A longer list of features and limitations is on the [wiki feature list](https://github.com/hioa-cs/IncludeOS/wiki/Features)

# Try it out!

## Prerequisites for building IncludeOS VM's
  * **Ubuntu 14.04 LTS x86_64**, Vanilla, either on a physical or virtual machine (A virtualbox VM works fine)
     * For the full source build, you'll need at least 1024 MB memory
     * In order to support VGA graphics inside a VM, we recommend a lightweight GUI, such as  [lubuntu](http://lubuntu.net/blog/lubuntu-1404-trusty-tahr-released) which runs great inside a virtual machine.
         * *NOTE:* Graphics is by no means necessary, as all IncludeOS output by default will be routed to the serial port, and in Qemu,
     * The install scripts may very well work on other flavours on Linux, but we haven't tried. Please let us know if you do.
     * **Building on a Mac:** we have done a successful build from bundle, directly on a Mac. It's a work in progress, but see [./etc/install_osx.sh](./etc/install_osx.sh) for details.
  * You'll need `git` to clone from github.

Once you have a system with the prereqs (virtual or not), you can choose a full build from source, or a fast build from binaries:

## A) Install libraries from binary bundle (fast)
    $ sudo apt-get install git
    $ git clone https://github.com/hioa-cs/IncludeOS
    $ cd IncludeOS
    $ ./etc/install_from_bundle.sh

**The script will:**
* Install the required dependencies: `curl make clang nasm bridge-utils qemu`
* Download the latest binary release bundle from github, using the github API.
* Unzip the bundle to `$INCLUDEOS_INSTALL_LOC` - which you can set in advance, or which defaults to `$HOME`
* Create a network bridge called `include0`, for tap-networking
* Build the vmbuilder, which turns your service into a bootable image
* Copy `vmbuild` and `qemu-ifup` from the repo, over to `$INCLUDEOS_HOME`

**Time:**
About a minute or two (On a 4-core virtualbox Ubuntu VM, runing on a 2015 MacBook Air)

## B) Completely build everything from source (slow)
    $ sudo apt-get install git
    $ git clone https://github.com/hioa-cs/IncludeOS
    $ cd IncludeOS
    $ ./install.sh
    
**The script will:**
* Install all the tools required for building IncludeOS, and all libraries it depends on:
  * `build-essential make nasm texinfo clang cmake ninja-build subversion zlib1g-dev libtinfo-dev`
* Build a GCC cross compiler along the lines of the [osdev howto](http://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler) which we really only need to build `libgcc` and `newlib`.
* Build [Redhat's newlib](https://sourceware.org/newlib/) using the cross compiler, and install it according to `./etc/build_newlib.sh`. The script will also install it to the mentioned location.
* Build a 32-bit version of [LLVM's libc++](http://libcxx.llvm.org/) tailored for IncludeOS. 
* Build and install the IncludeOS library, which your service will be linked with.
* Build and install the `vmbuild` tool, which turns your service into a bootable disk image.

**Time:** 
On a VM with 2 cores and 4 GB RAM, running Ubuntu 14.04, running ./install.sh takes about 33 minutes depending on bandwidth.

**NOTE:** Both scripts will install packages, and as such parts will require sudo access.

### Testing the installation

A successful setup should enable you to build and run a virtual machine. Running the test-script:

    IncludeOS$ ./test.sh 

will build and run a [this example service](./examples/demo_service/service.cpp). 

**Things to note**
* The default test script will only work on Linux, and uses Qemu (with KVM if available). To run IncludeOS directly on VirtualBox, see `etc/vboxrun.sh`
* There is no shell! IncludeOS is a unikernel, and so it will only run one process. Think of an IncludeOS VM as a local process.
* There is no VGA! So, nothing will show up on the "screen" if you're using a GUI (i.e. if you run IncludeOS directly in virtualbox) We did write a vga module at one point, but we never use it; output to serial port works very well. We'll add VGA support in the future, as a package.
* You should be able to ping the VM. Its IP-address will be stated in the boot-time output from IncldueOS 
* You should also be able to open a simple webpage on the VM, by entering the IP into a browser, inside the development machine.
* How to get out? The test script starts [qemu](http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page) with the `--nographics`-option. This will by default reroute stdin and stdout to the terminal. To exit the virtual machine, you can go via the [Qemu monitor](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/QEMU/Monitor#Virtual_machine). The command for entering the monitor is `Ctrl+a c`, or to exit directly, `Ctrl+a x`.
   * *NOTE*: This keyboard shortcut may not work if you're interacting with your development environment is via a VirtualBox GUI, over putty, inside a `screen` etc. If you find a good solution for a certain platform (i.e. putty to VirtualBox on Windows), please let us know so we can update our wiki.

## Writing a service
Developing IncludeOS services should be done completely separately from IncludeOS repository. All you need is compiled and installed libraries, in your `$INNCLUDEOS_HOME` directory (`$HOMOE/IncludeOS_install by default`). The [./seed](./seed) directory contains everything a service needs to build and link with IncludeOS. 

*NOTE: Don't develop inside the seed directory; the point is to be able to reuse the seed to create new blank services*

### Create a new service by copying the seed

1. Copy the [./seed](./seed) directory to a convenient location like `~/your_service`. You can then start implementing the `Service::start` function in the `Service` class, located in [your_service/service.cpp](./seed/service.cpp) (Very simple example provided). This function will be called once the OS is up and running.  
2. Enter the name of your service in the first line of the [seed Makefile](./seed/Makefile). This will be the base for the name of the final disk image.

**Example:**
```
     $ cp -r seed ~/my_service
     $ cd ~/my_service
     $ emacs service.cpp
     ... add your code
     $ ./run.sh my_service.img
```
Take a look at the [examples](./examples). These all started out as copies of the same seed.

### Helper scripts
There's a convenience script, [./seed/run.sh](./seed/run.sh), which has the "Make-vmbuild-qemu" sequence laid out, with special options for debugging (It will add debugging symbols to the elf-binary and start qemu in debugging mode, ready for connection with `gdb`. More on this inside the script.). I use this script to run the code, where I'd normally just run the program from a shell. Don't worry, it's fast, even in nested/emulated mode.

### Using VirtualBox for development
  * VirtualBox does not support nested virtualization (a [ticket](https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/4032) has been open for 5 years). This means you can't use the kvm module to run IncludeOS from inside virtualbox, but you can use Qemu directly, so developing for IncludeOS in a virtualbox VM works. It will be slower, but a small VM still boots in no time. For this reason, this install script does not require kvm or nested virtualization.
  * You might want to install Virtual box vbox additions, if you want screen scaling. The above provides the prerequisites for this (compiler stuff). 

### Debugging with Bochs
* If you want to debug the bootloader, or inspect memory, registers, flags etc. using a GUI, you need to install [Bochs](http://bochs.sourceforge.net/). This is because `gdb` only works for objects with debugging symbols, which we don't have for our bootloader. See `./etc/bochs_installation.sh` for build options, and `./etc/.bochsrc` for an example configuration file (which specifies a <1MB disk).

## C++ Guidelines
We are currently far from it, but in time we'd like to adhere as much as possible to the [ISO C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines), maintained by the [Jedi Council](https://isocpp.org/). When (not if) you find code in IncludeOS which doesn't adhere, please let us padawans know, in the issue-tracker - or even better, fix it in your own fork, and send us a pull-request. 
  * *Note: We're not using the Guidelines Support Library, but we probably will at some point. This means we're not ready to follow guidelines that requires this library yet.*
